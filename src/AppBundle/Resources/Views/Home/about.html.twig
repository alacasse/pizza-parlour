        Assignment:

        You will be writing a small app for a small pizza parlour. This pizza parlour has 1 pizza with three optional toppings. It's very sad.

        Design two database tables. One is a customer table. One is a pizza table, you can use a column for each ingredient. Each pizza order generates a record in the pizza table, tied to a customer.

        Next, design and implement a PHP program to capture pizza orders. Your solution will be evaluated on both the quality of the design and the quality of the implementation. List any frameworks that you use.
